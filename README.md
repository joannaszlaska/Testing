# About me
Hello, this is my first steps in manual testing. I would like to present simple examples of testing two applications, which I made by myself. It is currency-converter and to do list. You can view test cases and bug reports in the added folders.
# Here are my applications:
## [currency-converter](https://joannaszlaska.github.io/currency-converter/)
## [to-do-list](https://joannaszlaska.github.io/to-do-list/)
